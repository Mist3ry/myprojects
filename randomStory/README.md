## Random Story Project

The idea of that project is to write a template with the story about something. And replace the missing words in the text with the corresponding ones in story-template folder.


For example " I was born in <country> and my name is <name>" will replace <labels> with the words from story-template/country.txt and story-template/name.txt
And at result will be something like that : " I was born in Germany and my name is JACOB". Files content and template can be changed, but the default ones in the story-template folder.
